# Five-Spice-2.0-
This is Five Spice 2.0 --- improved heavily based on 1.0

The first version was made 3 months ago and has only two pages, because at that time I just learned basic HTML 
and basic CSS. I had huge fun through this little project. 

So I decided to continue the journey ---- In the following 3 months, I learned javaScript fundemental,jQuery,
and basic Node js. Credits go to ninja @iamshaunjp ! His tutorials are just FANTASTIC.


To brush up the new skills, I made a lot of(or almost complete) changes based on 1.0. **(NOTE: the texts are not original, I looked them up everywhere. Here I just want to build a website to carry some info)**

## New Features:
 * Host local server
 * Dynamic data
 * Another 7 pages added
 * Fading homepage images
 * Sliding content
 * Navigation bar
 * Search bar
 * Sticky bar
 * Checkbox
 * Tab event
 * Footer and header
 
 Check it out and Merry Xmas :christmas_tree:
